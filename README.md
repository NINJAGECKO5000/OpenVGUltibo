This is a project to build a universal framework for Digital Dashes and guages using Raspberry Pi's. The final outcome idealy would be a robust framework that you can build your gauge setup in a GUI editor, and upload a .XML to the PI with the layout and settings. 
Ideally sensor or Canbus Inputs would come in over USB to make it simple. with all the boards sharing a canbus network.
